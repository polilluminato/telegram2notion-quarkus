Telegram2Notion is a small application developed with the [Quarkus framework](https://quarkus.io/) with which it is possible to save links that are sent to a Telegram Bot in a Notion database. It is also possible to tag the links sent to the bot with hashtags to better organize your database.

Here is a small demo of the application:

![Telegram2Notion Quarkus Demo](./docs/videos/telegram-notion-quarkus-demo.gif)

With some small configurations you can configure the application to suit other use cases such as:

- send expenses and add custom tag
- send short messages to simulate a todo-list
- add appointments in a database with calendar view
- ... your imagination is the limit ðŸ¤“
