# Configuration

## Telegram

First you have to create a telegram bot using [@BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather). Once a conversation began use its commands and click on `/start`. Then follow the procedure:
* On the command list select the command `/newbot` and choose a name for your bot, for example: `MyAwesomeBot`
* Choose an username for your bot, it must end with `bot`, for example: `myawesome_bot`
* At this point Botfather will tell you that the creation has taken place successfully and will send you a message with the token to be used to interact with the bot via HTTP API. We will use this token in the quarkus section
* You can start a new conversation with your bot from the `telegram.me/<bot_username>` to verify that everything was created correctly.
